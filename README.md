🧩 Django Web Application Project
Overview
This is a full-stack web application built with Django as the backend framework and enhanced with JavaScript for interactivity. The project is designed to explore modern Python web development techniques, cybersecurity practices, and alternative architectures such as SaaS vs self-hosted. It includes optional extensions into location-aware mobile experiences and rich front-end integration.

🚀 Features
✅ Django-powered dynamic website

✅ SQLite or PostgreSQL database backend (MongoDB optional)

✅ JavaScript-enhanced UI with potential Vue/React integration

✅ Secure by design: OWASP testing, Cloudflare, SQLi defense

✅ Optional mobile and geolocation support

✅ Exploratory support for BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) and proximity tracking

✅ Deployment-ready and SaaS-comparable architecture with Firebase variant

📦 Setup & Installation
Install Dependencies

Database

Default: SQLite

Optional: Add PostgreSQL or MongoDB support (via Djongo or external service)

Front-End Integration

Explore tools like django-unicorn for reactive components

Optional: use React or Vue as a front-end layer

🛠️ Development Milestones
Phase 1: Core App
 Setup local dev environment

 Build a basic Django app (e.g., TODO list or recipe finder)

 Add models and views

 Use SQLite (upgradeable to PostgreSQL)

Phase 2: Frontend Enhancements
 Add interactive features with JavaScript

 Explore dynamic rendering with React/Vue

 Learn Server-Side Rendering (SSR) vs Client-Side Rendering (CSR)

 Style the UI with CSS frameworks

Phase 3: Security & Hardening
 Run OWASP scanner

 Implement authentication

 Understand and guard against:

SQL Injection

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

CSRF attacks

 Setup WAF (Cloudflare + TBD backend)

 Consider Docker containerization for isolation

📱 Mobile View & Location Features
 Add responsive design

 Request location permissions

 Use location for:

Task suggestions

Logging task completion coordinates

Peer proximity awareness (BLE, WiFi, GPS)

 Integrate with:

Google Maps API

Leaflet / OpenLayers (OpenStreetMap-based)

🔐 Cybersecurity Checklist
Task	Description
OWASP Testing	Run unauthenticated → authenticated tests
Auth	Implement login system securely
Firewall	Frontend via Cloudflare, backend TBD
SQL Injection	Sanitize DB queries
Containers	Docker for app encapsulation (optional)

🌐 Networking & SaaS Alternatives
Understand self-hosted Django vs hosted Firebase + Python

Compare deployment complexity, cost, and scalability

Learn about authentication differences, realtime DBs, and hosted functions

📌 Notes
This project is exploratory and modular — you can experiment with NoSQL, JS frameworks, and different deployment strategies.

Be curious: it's a chance to combine modern web tech, cybersecurity, and hardware proximity ideas.
